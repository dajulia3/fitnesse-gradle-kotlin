The same initial account balance, over time, can earn very different interest depending on whether the
interest is simple or compounding.
APY corresponds to compounding interest.

In a real acceptance test suite, we'd probably link to separate pages for different transactions.

Interest is calculated in a number of different ways.

APR corresponds to simple interest (noncompounding).
